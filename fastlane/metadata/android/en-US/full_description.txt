USBDevInfo (USB Descriptor Explorer) is an utility for inspecting USB devices with clear, structured details—built for debugging, validation, and reverse-engineering.

Connect a device and view:

	- Vendor/Product IDs (VID/PID) with resolved names (when available)

	- USB version, speed, class/subclass/protocol

	- Configurations, interfaces, and endpoint breakdowns

	- Power hints (max power)

	- Input peripherals (keyboard/mouse) via Android InputManager

With per-device permission granted, USBDevInfo can also retrieve advanced data such as:

	- String descriptors (manufacturer, product, serial, interface strings)

	- Descriptor tree parsed from raw descriptors

	- Device state (GET_STATUS / GET_CONFIGURATION / GET_INTERFACE where supported)

	- HID report descriptors and a readable summary

Designed to be fast, privacy-friendly, and practical for daily troubleshooting.
