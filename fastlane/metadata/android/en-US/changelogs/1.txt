## Changelogs notes

### Added
- USB device discovery and live "devices changed" updates (attach/detach).
- Unified device list including:
  - Standard USB devices (via `UsbManager`)
  - External keyboards/mice detected as input devices (via `InputManager`)
- Device details screen with a structured, readable layout:
  - Identity (VID/PID, vendor/product names, serial)
  - USB specification (version, speed, class/subclass/protocol)
  - Location (device path, Android deviceId, port number)
  - Configurations, interfaces, and endpoints with clear summaries
- Permission flow for per-device USB access (required for advanced reads).

### Advanced USB inspection (when permission is granted)
- Raw device descriptor parsing (bcdUSB, bcdDevice, EP0 packet size, string indexes).
- Descriptor tree parsing from raw descriptors (bLength/bDescriptorType walk).
- String descriptor retrieval:
  - Language IDs + preferred language selection
  - Manufacturer / Product / Serial
  - Interface strings (iInterface) when present
- Device state probing via control transfers:
  - GET_CONFIGURATION / GET_STATUS / GET_INTERFACE (alt settings)
- HID report descriptor extraction (GET_DESCRIPTOR 0x22) with basic report summary.

### History
- Automatic history recording of viewed devices.
- History entry detail screen aligned with live device detail presentation.
- “Open live device info” action when the device is currently connected.

### UI/UX
- Clean card-based layout with expandable sections for technical blocks.
- Auto-hiding of empty/unsupported sections to reduce clutter.
- Copy-friendly key/value rows for IDs and fields.

### Notes / Limitations
- Some advanced fields depend on device support and Android USB stack behavior; not all devices expose raw descriptors or HID report descriptors reliably.
- InputManager-based devices may not provide full USB descriptor access (shown as input devices).
